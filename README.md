# Design Patterns using Typescript

Design pattern exercises implemented with TypeScript. I've been studying design patterns using various material like, the Head First Design Patterns book. Along with YouTube channels like Derek Banas and Christopher Okhravi, who have playlists explaining these design patterns using Java.

Since these sources are using Java, I thought it'd be nice to change things up and use TypeScript for my exercises. TypeScript provides things like types and class inheritance that is my express than just using vanilla JavaScript.
